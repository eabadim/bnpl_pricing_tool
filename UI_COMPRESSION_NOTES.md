## Summary

Compressed the UI to show more information without scrolling by:
1. Removing the "Max Interest-Free Installments" metric

4. Collapsing detailed sections into expanders
5. Removing unnecessary section separators

---

## Detailed Changes

### 1. **Removed "Max Interest-Free Installments" Metric** ‚úÖ

**Reason**: User requested removal to save space

**Location**: Was in 4th column of summary metrics

---

### 2. **Consolidated Metrics (4+4 columns ‚Üí 6 columns)** ‚úÖ

**Before:**
```
Summary Metrics (4 columns):
- Effective Yield
- Required APR / Current APR
- Profit Margin
- Max Interest-Free Installments

---

Capital Deployment Timeline (4 columns):
- Loan Duration
- Settlement Delay
- Capital Deployment Period
- Settlement Delay Benefit
```

**After:**
```
Key Metrics (6 columns):
- Effective Yield
- Required APR / Current APR
- Profit Margin
- Loan Duration
- Capital Deploy
- Settle Benefit
```

**Space Saved**: ~200-300px vertical space by removing a full section and separator

---

### 3. **Reduced Chart Heights** ‚úÖ

**Before**: All charts were 400px high

**After**: All charts are 300px high

Charts affected:
- Yield vs Default Rate: 400 ‚Üí 300px
- Yield vs Installment Count: 400 ‚Üí 300px
- Required APR vs Merchant Commission: 400 ‚Üí 300px
- Yield vs Settlement Delay: 400 ‚Üí 300px

**Space Saved**: ~400px (4 charts √ó 100px each)

---

### 4. **Collapsed Sections into Expanders** ‚úÖ

**Revenue & Cost Breakdown**:
- Before: Always visible, took ~300px
- After: In expander `üí∞ Revenue & Cost Breakdown` (collapsed by default)
- Space Saved: ~300px when collapsed

**Interest-Bearing vs Interest-Free Comparison**:
- Before: Always visible with header and separator, took ~250px
- After: In expander `üîÑ Interest-Bearing vs Interest-Free Comparison` (collapsed by default)
- Space Saved: ~250px when collapsed

**Key Insights**:
- Before: Always visible with header and separator, took ~200px
- After: In expander `üí° Key Insights` (collapsed by default)
- Space Saved: ~200px when collapsed

---

### 5. **Removed Unnecessary Section Separators** ‚úÖ

**Before**:
```
---
Summary Metrics
---
Capital Deployment Timeline
---
Revenue & Cost Breakdown
---
Sensitivity Analysis
---
Interest-Bearing vs Interest-Free
---
Key Insights
---
```

**After**:
```
Key Metrics
Float Warning (if applicable)
üí∞ Revenue & Cost Breakdown (expander)
üìä Sensitivity Analysis
üîÑ Interest-Bearing vs Interest-Free (expander)
üí° Key Insights (expander)
```

**Space Saved**: ~50px per separator √ó 4 removed = ~200px

---

### 6. **Shortened Metric Labels** ‚úÖ

**Before**:
- "Capital Deployment Period"
- "Settlement Delay Benefit"
- "Effective Yield vs Default Rate"
- "Required APR vs Merchant Commission (to hit target yield)"
- "Effective Yield vs Settlement Delay (Longer delay = Higher yield)"

**After**:
- "Capital Deploy"
- "Settle Benefit"
- "Effective Yield vs Default Rate"
- "Required APR vs Merchant Commission"
- "Yield vs Settlement Delay"

**Benefit**: Cleaner, more compact metric names

---

### 7. **Compressed Float Warning** ‚úÖ

**Before** (Multi-line formatted warning):
```
‚ö†Ô∏è FLOAT SCENARIO DETECTED ‚ö†Ô∏è

Settlement delay (30 days) ‚â• Loan duration (28 days)

What this means:
- Customers pay ALL installments BEFORE Tafi pays the merchant
- Tafi holds customer money for 2 days
- Zero (or negative) net capital deployed
- Yield calculation uses proxy deployment period (7.0 days)
- Actual yield is effectively infinite (no capital at risk)

This is an extremely favorable scenario but may not be realistic...
```

**After** (Single line):
```
‚ö†Ô∏è FLOAT SCENARIO: Settlement (30d) ‚â• Loan (28d) ‚Äî Customers pay BEFORE merchant.
Float: 2d. Actual yield: INFINITE.
```

**Space Saved**: ~150px

---

## Total Space Saved

| Change | Space Saved |
|--------|-------------|
| Consolidated metrics section | ~250px |
| Reduced chart heights | ~400px |
| Revenue breakdown (collapsed) | ~300px |
| Comparison table (collapsed) | ~250px |
| Key insights (collapsed) | ~200px |
| Removed separators | ~200px |
| Compressed float warning | ~150px |
| **TOTAL** | **~1,750px** |

## User Experience Impact

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ See all key metrics at once without scrolling
- ‚úÖ Charts still fully functional at 300px height
- ‚úÖ Advanced details accessible via expanders
- ‚úÖ Cleaner, more professional appearance
- ‚úÖ Faster initial load perception

**Cons**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Revenue breakdown hidden by default (but easily accessible)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Comparison table hidden by default (but easily accessible)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Insights hidden by default (but easily accessible)

**Net Result**: Much more information visible on first screen while maintaining full functionality.
